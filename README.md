BVMCO EMI maintenance web application 
BVMCO is a comprehensive sales and finance management system designed to streamline product sales, credit-based purchases, and EMI collections in rural areas. The platform enables structured record-keeping, transaction tracking, and reporting for efficient operations.

Key Features & Workflow:
Admin Management:

The admin can create and manage records for Product Groups, Subgroups, Products, Sales Agents, Villages, and Village Agents.
Assign villages to sales agents and village agents for seamless operations.
Sales & Order Management:

Sales Agents oversee multiple villages, with each village assigned a Village Agent.
Village agents personally engage with customers, showcasing products and assisting them in placing orders.
If a customer lacks sufficient funds for a down payment, they can still place an order and proceed with payment later.
Billing & EMI Generation:

Once a customer has the necessary funds, they make a down payment, and the system automatically generates an EMI schedule for the remaining balance.
The EMI structure ensures flexibility, allowing customers to pay in installments.
EMI Collection & Tracking:

Village Agents monitor EMI dues and visit customers to collect payments.
Since many customers may not have sufficient funds to pay a full EMI installment, partial payments are supported.
At the end of each day, the collected EMI amount is deposited with the respective Sales Agent, who marks payments as collected.
Sales Agents can also directly collect EMIs when required.
Reporting & Insights:

The system provides detailed reports to assist Admins, Sales Agents, and Village Agents in managing sales, outstanding EMIs, customer payments, and overall financial health.
Reports include EMI dues, collection summaries, pending payments, and agent performance, ensuring data-driven decision-making.
Conclusion:
BVMCO serves as a digital backbone for microfinance-based product sales, ensuring transparency, efficient collections, and better financial management. By bridging the gap between customers and sales teams, it simplifies order processing, EMI tracking, and payment collections while empowering field agents with essential data and insights.
